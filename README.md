# Get an Artist's top tracks using Spotify API (US by default)

A web app built using React, axios, CORS and node.js with Express, makes use of Spotify's Web APIs to get top tracks based on the artist's name. 

Steps to run the app locally:
1. Go to developer.spotify.com and follow the steps to create an app and obtain client_id and client_secret.
2. Create a .env file in the backend folder to save the spotify client credentials in the following format:
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
3. cd into the ui folder, run 'npm install' and then run 'npm start'.
4. cd into the backend folder, run 'npm install' and then run 'node server.js'.
